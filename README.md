Overview

This repo contains R scripts and an RMarkdown file used to analyze data on the American working population recorded since the 1970's in the United States. It uses data obtained from the General Social Survey by the University of Chicago. The purpose of this report was to assess the ways in which data on America's working population are recorded and discuss the skepticism that result from the data painting an incomplete picture of the working American population. The final report can be viewed here.

More information on the dataset can be found on the General Social Survey website.
